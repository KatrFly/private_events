# README

This website was initially build as an assignment for the ruby course of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events) but was later expanded with new features to serve as a portfolio website.

Private events is a rails website where users can log in and create events. These events can have 3 types of visibility: public, only visible to friends or only visible to invited users. Invitations can be created for the latter by filling in a form after which an invitation is send to every invited person. Users can send friend-requests to eachother, a new friendship is created when the other user accepts. Visitors of the website who are not logged in can only see restricted information about the event, such as the date and the place. However they can not see which users are attending the event or attend themselves.

The website is designed to be displayed on a laptop or desktop screen. It will be upgraded to a more mobile responsive design in the near future.
